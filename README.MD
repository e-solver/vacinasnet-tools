I'm developing this project because here at vacinas.net I have many needs:

1. Solve painful demands quickly
2. Learn full-stack web development and other subjects like Git, Dev Ops, automated tests, etc.
3. Provide tools and APIs to help the team with heavy tasks that could be automated

We have our own backoffice system written in TS called Jenner and there are stuff that I didn't learn yet. Heavy demands like clinic homologation, voucher generation and daily demands consume too much of my time, preventing me from studying those subjects and implementing new features on Jenner.

Then why not write tools to deal with those painful and time consuming tasks while I learn on practice these subjects and apply them here, right?

Basically this project is a record of my learning, that I need to gradually improve in order to become a full-stack developer and deal with our backoffice system development.
